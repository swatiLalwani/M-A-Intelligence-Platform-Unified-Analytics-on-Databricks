🏟️ AtliQon × Sportsbar — M&A Intelligence Platform
📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a post-merger analytics platform built on the Databricks Lakehouse, designed to help executives and business stakeholders analyze performance after AtliQon (a global consumer sports equipment company) acquires Sportsbar (a fast-growing sports nutrition startup).

🚀 Strategic Recommendations 
🔹 Inventory Cross-Optimization
Identify warehouses where AtliQon equipment and Sportsbar nutrition products can be co-located to reduce last-mile shipping costs and improve delivery speed.
🔹 Customer Loyalty Integration
Leverage the 66% New Customer rate from Marketing analytics to launch an “Athlete” Loyalty Program, rewarding customers who purchase across both equipment and nutrition categories.
🔹 Process Automation
Expand the orchestrated pipeline to include real-time low-stock alerts across both companies, preventing stockouts during high-demand post-merger periods.
